We have three Juniper routers , Router-1, router-2, router-3 that are connected on PTP trunking. 
router-1 and router-2 are running OSPF backbone in area 0, and advertising all their networks to OSPF. 
Router router-1 also has a five networks with prefixes in class C ip addresses which should be 
redistributed or advertised as originate class C prefixes on router router-3. router router-1 and 
router  router-2 are iBGP peers on ASN 1 with  acting as the router-2 acts as the BGP route-reflector 
client and also originating 3 prefixes in class C. Additionaly router-2 has another PTP neighbor which 
is router-3.  Router router-2 and roouter-r3 have ebgp peering on ASN 2 . Router router-3 also are 
EBGP multihop neighbors with router router-1. Can you give me a configuration for the three routers 
using routing policy to redistribute networks from OSPF to bgp and test connectivity with ping. 
Certainly! Here's an example configuration for the three routers to redistribute networks from OSPF
 to BGP and test connectivity with ping. Please note that this is just an example, and you may need 
 to modify the configuration to suit your specific network requirements.

how about the same configuration for cisco routers 
Sure! Here's an example configuration for the three Cisco routers to redistribute networks from OSPF to BGP and test connectivity with ping. Again, please note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the configuration to suit your specific network requirements.

Oops, sorry about that! Here's the rest of the configuration for Router-3:

route-map BGP-to-OSPF permit 10
 match ip address 30
 set metric 100
 set origin igp
 set community 2:2
 set local-preference 200

In this configuration, Router-1 and Router-2 are running OSPF as an IGP and BGP as an EGP. Router-1 is advertising its five networks with prefixes in class C IP addresses to OSPF and redistributing those routes into BGP with a route map named OSPF-to-BGP. Router-2 is redistributing BGP routes into OSPF with a route map named BGP-to-OSPF. Router-2 is also acting as a BGP route reflector client for Router-1.

Router-1 and Router-2 are iBGP peers on ASN 1, and Router-2 and Router-3 are eBGP peers on ASN 2. Additionally, Router-2 has a PTP neighbor, which is Router-3.

To test connectivity with ping, you can use the following commands on each router:

On Router-1:


ping 192.168.1.2
ping 192.168.2.1
ping 192.168.2.2
ping 192.168.3.1
On Router-2:


ping 192.168.1.1
ping 192.168.2.2
ping 192.168.3.1
ping 192.168.3.2
On Router-3:


ping 192.168.2.1
ping 192.168.1.1
ping 192.168.1.2
ping 192.168.3.2
These ping tests should verify that the routers are correctly configured and able to communicate with each other.

The three routers also have class A Loopback ip addresses. 
Sure, if you want to include loopback interfaces on the three routers, you can add them to the OSPF and BGP configurations to advertise and redistribute them as well. Here's an updated configuration for the three routers:

On Router-1:




```
set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.1.1/32
set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/0.0
set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface lo0.0

```

set policy-options policy-statement BGP-to-OSPF term BGP from route-filter 10.0.0.0/8 exact
set policy-options policy-statement BGP-to-OSPF term BGP then accept
On Router-3:



set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.3.3/32

set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface lo0.0

set protocols bgp group EBGP multihop ttl 2
set policy-options policy-statement

Here's the rest of the configuration for Router-3:



set policy-options policy-statement BGP-to-OSPF term BGP from protocol bgp
set policy-options policy-statement BGP-to-OSPF term BGP from route-filter 10.0.0.0/8 exact
set policy-options policy-statement BGP-to-OSPF term BGP then accept
You can test connectivity by pinging between the loopback addresses on the three routers. For example, from Router-1 you can ping Router-2's loopback with the following command:

bash

ping 10.0.2.2 source 10.0.1.1
And from Router-1 you can ping Router-3's loopback with the following command:

bash

ping 10.0.3.3 source 10.0.1.1
Similarly, you can ping the loopback addresses on Router-1 from Router-2 and Router-3 using the source option to specify the source IP address.
